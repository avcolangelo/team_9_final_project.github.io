<p>The written report produced by your team is central to this project. This will detail how you completed your project, and should cover data collection and cleaning, exploratory analyses, alternative strategies, descriptions of approaches, and a discussion of results. We anticipate that your project will change somewhat over time; these changes and the reasons for them should be documented! You will write one report document per group, and be sure to include all group member names in the document.</p>

<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation:</h2>
<p>The motivation for our project was to create a sort of guide for Squirrel Watchers in NYC. Birdwatching is a common hobby and there are many books, websites and resources surrounding it. Unfortunately squirrel watching is not as popular and is mostly only active on college campuses. To bring more attention to this hobby, and to increase the number of squirrel watchers in NYC, we created our website to serve as a resource for the squirrel watching community in NYC. We wanted to help this community identify where one could watch certain squirrel behaviors (i.e. foraging and climbing), hear squirrel sounds (i.e. kuks and quaas), and identify if there was a pattern in where one could expect different interactions between squirrels and humans (i.e. the squirrel approaches humans or is indifferent) Since a lot of tourists visit NYC, we focused on Squirrel watching in Central Park.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Related work:</h2>
<p>The following website:<a href="https://www.prospectpark.org/visit-the-park/things-to-do/birdwatching/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMImM7nuKaa5gIViZOzCh1NYAGQEAAYASAAEgLlPPD_BwE" class="uri">https://www.prospectpark.org/visit-the-park/things-to-do/birdwatching/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMImM7nuKaa5gIViZOzCh1NYAGQEAAYASAAEgLlPPD_BwE</a> is a resource platform for birdwatching in Prospect Park that inspired some of the work and resources we included in our project. The Prospect park website shows a map with some of the best birding locations, our maps similarly try to identify where certain squirrel behaviors can be observed.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial questions:</h2>
<p>Some of our questions and their evolution are below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the probability of a certain squirrel in a certain area; visualize this probability/heat map.</li>
</ol>
<p>This question turned into a question of where certain behaviors had already been observed, and thus where a behavior could potentially be observed again.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Regression question: number (count) of squirrels seen eating as predicted by foraging.</li>
</ol>
<p>This question evolved into whether certain squirrel behaviors could predict the time of the day (AM or PM) in which the squirrel was observed. Different number of covariates were tested and one model won out. The prediction of the model as a whole was not good. But the model could be improved potentially if individual squirrels were tracked all day as opposed to tracking observations of different squirrel appearances.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Where are squirrels are most concentrated?</li>
</ol>
<p>We decided not to pursue this question as our general direction switched from being where most squirrels could be observed to how we could use squirral behaviors to predict time of day for squirrel sightings.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What are the most common squirrel behaviors?</li>
</ol>
<p>From our analysis of behavior foraging is the most common squirrel behavior.</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data:</h2>
<p>For our project we used the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Data from NYC Open Data. Over all the data set did not include much missing data, but in the event that a particular variable was under analysis with missing data we dropped the rows with missing data.</p>
<p>For our Squirrel Behavior maps we imported the data and filtered the data to only include behaviors. We recoded the behavior variables (running, chasing, climbing, eating, foraging, tail flags and tail twitches into factor and then integer variables. To create three different maps, we filtered the data and created three different mini data sets (behavior_data, sound_data, and interact_data). We then used leaflet to plot the maps of the behaviors.</p>
<p>For our Common Behaviors analysis, we imported the data and re-coded the behaviors (running, chasing, climbing, eating and foraging) as factor variables. We then recoded the behaviors from TRUE/FALSE to No and the associated behavior (i.e. for running, FALSE was recoded to No, and TRUE was recoded to running). We then tidied the data and used pivot longer to capture all behaviors in one column (activity).</p>
<p>For our Logistic regression analysis, we imported the data but not very much data cleaning was necessary, as all the squirrel behaviors were already coded as TRUE or FALSE and had no missing values. We did create a new variable to use as an ID variable to help split the data into training and testing sets. We also recoded the AM and PM response variable to be 0 or 1 (1 for AM). We let the step function create 1 logistic regression model, and then removed a few of the less significant covariates to create a model with better parsimony.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory analysis:</h2>
<p>When looking at the squirrel behavior maps…</p>
<p>When looking at the most common squirrel behaviors, we removed the category of “other activities” from analysis because the range of entries varied too widely (which would make it difficult to visualize effectively) and would be very time consuming to wrangle. Instead, we decided to focus on the five main categories of behaviors. When looking at the primary fur color of squirrels, 55 squirrels had missing data for fur color, so to simplify the visualization we decided to remove the missing data.</p>
</div>
<div id="additional-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Additional analysis:</h2>
<div id="logistic-regression" class="section level4">
<h4>Logistic regression</h4>
<p><strong>Motivation:</strong></p>
<p>Our motivation for this analysis was to try to use statistical techniques to analyze associations between various squirrel behaviors. We began by considering if any specific squirrel behavior could be modeled by the other squirrel behaviors. However, while thinking about the squirrel behaviors, we found ourselves wondering if any were associated with time of day, and that evolved into us deciding to use logistic regression models to see if we could accurately predict the time of day an observation was recorded (AM vs PM) using the squirrel behaviors observed.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<p>The results of our logistic regression models suggest that many of the squirrel behaviors, such as eating, climbing, approaches, and indifferent are associated with a time of day. Eating is more strongly associated with PM, while climbing, approaches, and indifferent behaviors are more associated with AM. However, in using our models to create predictions, we found that the accuracy of both models was below 60%, which is quite poor! After examining the squirrel behaviors further, we noted that the observations had a median of 2 different squirrel behaviors per observation (out of 13 total), and so that could be a reason for the low predictive power. If the squirrels were observed for longer, and had more behaviors included per observation, it is possible we would have a logistic regression model with better predictive power.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion:</h2>
<p>From our data set we found that there were 3023 unique squirrels observed in Central Park in October of 2019. The three types of fur color observed were grey, cinnamon, and black with Grey Squirrel’s being the most observed type of colored squirrel. In regards to behavior, foraging was the most prominent behavior observed and chasing was the least common behavior observed. We didn’t really have much of a background in Squirrel behaviors and characteristics, but since the data was collected in the fall, we expected that squirrels would be mostly foraging since they are less active in the winter time. After some investigation we found that tree squirrels, like the Eastern Gray and American Red Squirrel, do not hibernate, but they do tend to sleep a lot during the winter months. We also found that squirrels usually live through the winter by putting their food in shallow holes for storage to serve as a food reserve in the winter and that throughout the fall, they maximize food consumption and body mass. Thus, our behavior analysis results line up with the behavior trends we found online. Overall the data was easy to work with since there was not much cleaning necessary, but it was limited in its predictive abilities and in its abilities to give information on squirrel behavior outside of the month of October and thus outside of the Fall season.</p>
